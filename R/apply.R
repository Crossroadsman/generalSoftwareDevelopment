#   At any R Q&A site, you'll frequently see an exchange like this one:
#
#     Q: How can I use a loop to [...insert task here...]?
#     A: Don't. Use one of the apply functions

# Apply functions:
# apply     Apply functions over array margins
# by        Apply a function to a data frame split by factors
# eapply    Apply a function over values in an environment
# lapply    Apply a function over a list or vector
# mapply    Apply a function to multiple list or vector arguments
# rapply    Recursively apply a function over a list
# sapply    Like lapply but try to simplify the result
# tapply    Apply a function over a ragged array

# Note: "margin" is just fancy speak for rows or columns or rows and columns
